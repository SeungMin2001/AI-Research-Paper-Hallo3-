# Title : Highly Dynamic and Realistic Portrait Image Animation with Diffusion Transformer Networks

## Abstract
- Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant, which are as follows:
  - handling Non-frontal perspectives (비정면적 관점 처리)
  - rendering dynamic objects around the portrait (초상화 주위의 동적 객체 렌더링)
  - generating immersive, realistic backgrounds (몰입감 있고 현실적인 배경 생성)
- The authors stated that:
  - we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers,
    ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. (기존 U-NET 방식에서 3D VAE 방식으로 바꿔서 진행)
- The approach we proposed demonstrates substantial improvements.
