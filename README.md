# Title : Highly Dynamic and Realistic Portrait Image Animation with Diffusion Transformer Networks

## Abstract
- Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant, which are as follows:
  - frontal perspectives (정면적 관점)
  - rendering dynamic objects around the portrait (초상화 주위의 동적 객체 렌더링)
  - generating immersive, realistic backgrounds (몰입감 있고 현실적인 배경 생성)
- The authors stated that:
  - we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers,
    ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences.
